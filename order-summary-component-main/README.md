## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about CSS layout deeply using both CSS grid and Flexbox. The characteristics between Grid and Flexbox can be compared through the usage of these two layout. 

Grid will be much more useful when contents inside of the container is not unit. In addition, we need to control them in 2D direction. We can consider grid as a responsive table as what we want.

For Flexbox, it will be much more useful in one-directional layout.
